## Preamble

> I often came across the opinion that it is better to use not standard output to the console, but full-fledged logging... However, the standard libraries do not provide exactly what I need... Therefore, I decided to make my own library! Which will implement the functionality I need.

I was inspired by the [colored-logs](https://pypi.org/project/colored-logs/) library.

---

*This library has been renamed to "Mighty logger", but this library used to be called "Qt Colored logger". You can search for old commits in this repository, but you can download the old build from the [link](https://pypi.org/project/qt-colored-logger/).*

- [Content](#content)

## Overview

The library implements the formation of a beautifully formatted colored text, similar to a log, which has all the necessary information:

- Device name and registered profile, system name, etc. (this data is displayed only once at the beginning of the logging)
- Log entry time
- Log entry category
- Log entry type
- Entry message

Any information to the output can be turned off (according to the default, everything is included). It is also possible to change the output settings during the logging process. It is possible to change the colors of the foreground text and the background, icons and animations.

## Installation

To install the library, enter the command:

```sh
pip install mighty_logger
```

## Usage

This is the simplest example of using the library:

```python
from mighty_logger import Logger

if __name__ == "__main__":
	logger = Logger()
	logger.message("Hello world!")
	print("\n".join(logger.might.buffer))
```

The outputs in console will contain the following text:

<pre>
-Unknown?entry> $DESKTOP-8KG0R64:User:Windows:10.0.19045:64bit:WindowsPE:AMD64
-?entry>          *2023-07-04 21:12:05.919593 üìù #STATUS: @MESSAGE - Hello world!
</pre>

## Troubleshooting

All functionality of the library has been tested by me, but if you have problems using it, the code does not work, have suggestions for optimization or advice for improving the style of the code and the name - I invite you [here](https://github.com/Nakama3942/mighty_logger/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) and [here](https://github.com/Nakama3942/mighty_logger/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

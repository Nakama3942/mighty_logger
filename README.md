## Preamble

<!--
This library it was renamed to "Mighty logger" but before this library named is "Qt Colored logger". Old commits may search in this repository, but download old build may on next link: https://pypi.org/project/qt-colored-logger/ .
-->

> I often came across the opinion that it is better to use not standard output to the console, but full-fledged logging... However, the standard libraries do not provide exactly what I need... Therefore, I decided to make my own library! Which will implement the functionality I need.

I was inspired by the [colored-logs](https://pypi.org/project/colored-logs/) library.

---

*This library has been renamed to "Mighty logger", but this library used to be called "Qt Colored logger". You can search for old commits in this repository, but you can download the old build from the [link](https://pypi.org/project/qt-colored-logger/).*

## Overview

The library implements the formation of a beautifully formatted colored text, similar to a log, which has all the necessary information:

- Device name and registered profile, system name, etc. (this data is displayed only once at the beginning of the logging)
- Log entry time
- Log entry status
- Log entry type
- Entry message

Any information to the output can be turned off (according to the default, everything is included). It is also possible to change the output settings during the logging process. It is possible to change the colors of the foreground text and the background, icons ~~and animations~~.

## Installation

Despite the fact that the library was originally developed for use in PyQt, it does not require PyQt to be installed, since this framework for outputting to Text fields, which support not only Plain Text, uses HTML and this library simply simplifies the logging process, since the creation process already formatted strings is registered in this library.

To install the library, enter the command:

```sh
pip install mighty_logger
```

## Usage

This is the simplest example of using the library:

```python
from mighty_logger import Logger
from mighty_logger.src import StatusMessagePatterns

if __name__ == "__main__":
    logger = Logger(program_name="Test", console_width=115)
    logger.message(status_message=StatusMessagePatterns.custom("Hooray"), message_text="Hello world!")
```

The outputs in console will contain the following text (GitHub, PyPi and possibly some other sites do not support displaying colors in Markdown - use resources that support them, such as PyCharm):

> <span style='background-color: #;'><span style='color: #ffd700;'>-Test?entry> $â–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆ^â–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆ@â–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆ:â–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆ:â–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆ:â–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆ:â–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆ</span></span><br>
> <span style='background-color: #;'><span style='color: #b0e0e6;'>-?entry> </span><span style='color: #da70d6;'>*2023-06-08 14:01:39.423493 </span>ðŸ’¬ <span style='color: #ffa500;'>#STATUS: </span><span style='color: #ff8c00;'>Hooray </span><span style='color: #afeeee;'>@MESSAGE - </span><span style='color: #b0e0e6;'>Hello world!</span></span><br>

## Troubleshooting

All functionality of the library has been tested by me, but if you have problems using it, the code does not work, have suggestions for optimization or advice for improving the style of the code and the name - I invite you [here](https://github.com/Nakama3942/mighty_logger/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) and [here](https://github.com/Nakama3942/mighty_logger/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
